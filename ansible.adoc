= Ansible 

== Installation (Ubuntu/Debian/Apt)

```
sudo apt install ansible -y
```

== Configuration

Ansible looks for configuration files:

* $ANSIBLE_CONFIG
* ./ansible.cfg
* /etc/ansible.cfg

== Hosts

The hosts file contains groups of hosts which can be used to execute ansible commands.

The following sample shows how to configure a group of hosts and variables
related to those hosts.

.Sample hosts File
```
[linux]
162.9.9.9
162.9.9.10

[linux:vars]
ansible_user=ansible
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=ansible_ed25519
```

To keep various configurations separate, it's easy enough to create
subdirectories, and include their own ansible.cfg and hosts file.

== Running Ad-hoc Commands

Arbitrary commands can be run using the ansible command with the `-a` parameter.

```
ansible linux -a "uptime"
```

== Playbook Files

This is the preferred way to run ansible commands.
