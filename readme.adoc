= Field Manual Repository

== Purpose

Field manuals sit somewhere between cheatsheets and full manuals.  Sometimes,
cheatsheets are useful, but they require a base knowledge of the application or
framework to use them effectively.  Manuals or full documentation is useful to
get a deep understanding of a subject, but can be a bit daunting when you are
first learning.

Field manuals are intended to give you a quick overview of a framework,
application or infrastructure - the main concepts required to start working.
